In this talk, I report on the general idea of database-driven network generation, its use for bioremediation, and the problems arising from inconsistent data.

Bioremediation is a natural occuring process, which is especially important for soil that is contamined with chemical pollutants. My goal was to examine, whether and how we can use computer programs fed from online databases to predict stategies how to faciliate certain degradation pathways.
Generally, those predictions are made with methods that act on network representations of metabolisms of cells, mainly flux balance analysis, but also other graph theoretic approaches.
In theory, such approaches allow predicting feasible organism consortia for biological treatment of specific envronmental situations. In practice, they require reaction data, which at the moment is of limited accuracy in online databases. Inconsistent data sets often hinder application of feasible methods. Thus, I examined the KEGG database, a prominent example of such online databases, spotting on inconsistencies and remediaton strategies, wich will presented in a condensed form. And I will discuss feasible strategies taking the shortcomings of such databases into account."
